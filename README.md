# Bamazon
This application was made using Node and mySQL workbench. The application mocs Amazons's Website store. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if our store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the app logs the phrase Out of stock.
